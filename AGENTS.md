# Mirada

A fast, folder-oriented image viewer. JDK 25 + JavaFX 27 + Maven, modular (JPMS, module
`com.mirada`). The image half of the viewers plan; a Reader for PDF and comics may follow and share
code with it, but nothing is extracted yet.

## Priorities

In this order, when they pull against each other:

1. **Speed.** Cold start, stepping to the next image, and decoding. A feature that costs either is
   not worth it.
2. **Keyboard navigation.** Everything reachable without the mouse.
3. **A command palette**, so every command can be found and run by name.

## Commands

- Run: `./mvnw javafx:run`, or on a file or folder: `./mvnw javafx:run -Djavafx.args=/path/to/photo.jpg`
- Test: `./mvnw test`
- Everything CI would check (tests, NullAway, format): `./mvnw verify`
- Format: `./mvnw spotless:apply` (Palantir, as in Termina and Torrenta)

Run Maven from the project root, on JDK 25 (the enforcer refuses others). CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `verify` on Linux, macOS and Windows for every push to `main`.

A user-visible change gets a line in `CHANGELOG.md`; a new dependency gets an entry in `NOTICE`.

## Architecture

| Package | What |
|---|---|
| `com.mirada.folder` | The "document": the images in one folder, in natural name order, and which one is showing (`FolderImages`, `NaturalOrder`, `ImageFormats`) |
| `com.mirada.image` | Loading: decoded images cached by path (`ImageCache`), EXIF orientation and the camera line (`Exif`, `Orientation`) |
| `com.mirada.ui` | The window (`ViewerWindow`), the zoom/pan canvas (`ImageViewport`) and its arithmetic (`Zoom`), the key map (`Command`), the theme |

Four decoders (`ImageFormats.Decoder`, by extension). JavaFX's own `Image` decodes BMP, GIF
(animated), JPEG and PNG in its background thread. The rest run on two decoder threads in
`ImageCache` and are copied into a `WritableImage` (`Pixels`):

| Formats | Decoder | How |
|---|---|---|
| WebP, TIFF, PSD | `ImageIoDecoder` | ImageIO with the TwelveMonkeys plugins, pure Java |
| HEIC, AVIF | `HeifDecoder` | libheif (with libde265 and dav1d), through FFM |
| JPEG XL | `JxlDecoder` | libjxl, through FFM, on every core via `libjxl_threads` |

The native libraries are found by `NativeLibraries`: first in the folder named by the
`mirada.codecs` system property (where the installers will bundle them), then the system's search
path, then Homebrew's. A missing library is not fatal: its files still list, and open with a message
naming the library. EXIF is metadata-extractor.

## Things that will bite you

- **JavaFX ignores EXIF orientation.** Phones store pixels as the sensor read them and tag how the
  phone was held; untreated, portrait photos lie on their side. `Orientation` is "mirror first, then
  turn clockwise", which is the order JavaFX applies a node's `scaleX` and `rotate`, and
  `ExifTest.mirrorThenTurnPutsTheCornerWhereTheTagSays` checks all eight against the tag's
  definition. Change one without the other and the mirrored orientations (2, 4, 5, 7) go wrong
  while the common ones still look right.
- **The window waits for both the pixels and the EXIF before it swaps images.** Showing the image as
  soon as it decodes flashes it sideways for a frame; showing it before it decodes flashes an empty
  canvas. `ImageCache.Entry.ready` completes when both are in, and `ViewerWindow.display` drops a
  result for any image other than the one most recently asked for (`wanted`).
- **Escape is ours, not the stage's.** JavaFX's full-screen exit key would leave full screen and
  then let the same press reach the key filter, which would close the window.
  `setFullScreenExitKeyCombination(NO_MATCH)` hands it to `Command.ESCAPE`: leave full screen if in
  it, otherwise close.
- **The cache holds full resolution, so it is small.** A decoded image is four bytes a pixel: a
  48-megapixel photo is about 190 MB. Three entries (the current image and one either side).
  Downsampled previews for the fitted view would let it hold more; not done.
- **The viewport turns an `ImageView`, it never copies pixels.** The view is laid out unturned at the
  zoomed size and rotated about its centre, so `layoutChildren` places that centre on the centre of
  where the turned image should stand. Sizes the user sees (status bar, fit) are the turned ones:
  `contentWidth`/`contentHeight`.
- **libheif and libjxl turn the image upright themselves; the EXIF orientation must then be
  skipped.** HEIF readers are required to apply the container's `irot`/`imir`, and iPhones write an
  EXIF orientation too; applying both turns the photo twice. `Decoder.turnsUpright` says which
  decoders do it, and `ImageCache` hands those an `Exif.upright()`. Not yet checked against a real
  iPhone photo.
- **The FFM bindings are hand-written against the C headers.** `heif_error` is returned by value (a
  struct; the handle takes a `SegmentAllocator` first), `JxlPixelFormat` has 4 bytes of padding
  before its `size_t`, and `JxlBasicInfo`'s offsets (`xsize` 4, `ysize` 8, `alpha_bits` 60) are
  libjxl's ABI from 0.7 on. A version that moves them breaks decoding, not the build:
  `NativeDecodersTest` is what notices. CI sets `MIRADA_REQUIRE_CODECS=1` on Linux and macOS so
  those tests fail rather than skip when a library stops loading.
- **Native access is enabled for `com.mirada`** in the javafx plugin's options (and for the
  classpath in surefire's `argLine`); without it the JDK warns on every launch. A jlink launcher
  will need the same flag.
- **libjxl writes to stderr on a bad file** (`decode.cc: invalid signature`). Noise, not a failure.
- **AWT is forced headless in `App.main`, as the first statement.** ImageIO and `BufferedImage` are
  `java.desktop`, and on macOS an initialised AWT contends with JavaFX for the AppKit run loop. Tests
  get the same through surefire's `java.awt.headless`.
- **The TwelveMonkeys readers are found by service lookup**, so nothing names their classes.
  `module-info` requires them anyway, or a jlink image would drop them silently, and
  `ImageFormatsTest.everyImageIoExtensionHasAReader` fails if one leaves the pom.
- **Screenshots on this Wayland desktop go through XWayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland backend, so
  the window is an X window: `xwininfo -root -tree | grep com.mirada.App` finds it and
  `import -window <id>` captures it. Key presses can be sent with XTest.

## Conventions

- **Extract the decision, then test it.** Anything with a rule in it — sort order, which key does
  what, zoom stops, where an image may be panned to — is a static method with its own tests (`Zoom`,
  `Command.forKey`, `NaturalOrder`, `FolderImages.select`, `Exif.summary`).
- **Fast first.** Startup and stepping are the product. Prefetch neighbours after the current image
  is up, never before it; no per-pulse work.

## Null annotations

JSpecify annotations, checked by NullAway in the main compile — Editora's setup, the same rules as
Termina and Torrenta. `mvn compile` fails on any null that can reach a type not marked nullable.

- **Every package is `@NullMarked`**, through its `package-info.java`; `NullMarkedPackagesTest` fails
  for a package without one, and if NullAway leaves the pom.
- **Mark what really may be null** (`private @Nullable Image image`), and prefer a shape that cannot
  be null when the null is an accident of the code.
- **NullAway does not follow a boolean that holds a null check**, nor a getter called twice: read it
  into a local and check inline.
- **JavaFX returns null more often than it looks:** `Node.getScene()`, `Scene.getWindow()`,
  `Path.getFileName()`, `Path.getParent()`, `FileChooser.showOpenDialog`.
- **Plumbing.** Only NullAway runs, only on the main compile. `.mvn/jvm.config` exports the javac
  internals Error Prone needs. JSpecify is `provided`, read through `requires static org.jspecify`.

## Not done

The command palette; a filmstrip; crop; slideshow; a menu bar or settings; tuned startup (AppCDS,
jlink, `-Pdist`), installers and file associations — and with the installers, **bundling libheif,
libde265, dav1d, libjxl and their dependencies** into the `mirada.codecs` folder (about 3 MB
compressed; decoders only, no x265 or aom). Animated WebP, AVIF and JPEG XL show their first frame.
JPEG XL is decoded in its own colour space, not converted to sRGB. Opening files from Finder on
macOS (needs AWT `Desktop`). Windows has no codec libraries in CI, so its native-decoder tests skip;
the app itself has not been run on Windows or macOS.
